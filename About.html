      <h2>What is Kaitiakitanga?</h2><!--This is the heading 2-->
      <p>Kaitiakitanga is a Maori word meaning guardianship, protection, and preserving our natural environment. It means taking action to save marine ecosystems, thrive, and expand its community. Another important factor is preserving and protecting endangered animals from going extinct.</p><!--This is the paragraph-->

      <h2>Why does practising Kaitiakitanga matter?</h2>
      <p>Practising Kaitiakitanga is important because it means preserving our land and ocean. So when we take actions to protect our environment, we make sure to keep it sustainable and available for future generations to enjoy. It also makes sure that our natural resources will be kept safe from risks and predators. Moreover, practising kaitiakitanga can bring communities closer and bring awareness to the environments around them.</p>

            <th>Plastic Pollution</th><!--This is the third table heading-->
            <td>Do you know how much plastic ends up in the ocean a day? 8 million pieces of plastic, these then get broken down into micro plastics by the movement and friction of waves, coming in contact with animals and sunlight. Because of this the plastics become nearly impossible to remove from the ocean (less than 5mm wide) because they are very small, it is harder for it to be filtered, it could also float around the ocean or sink under water depending on its density, resulting in spreading across the ocean. This is a big hazard as these microplastic could be consumed by species or absorbed by organisms like seaweed. Also, this could become even more dangerous as this species or organisms will reach us to eat for dinner or lunch.</td><!--this is the first table data for the second row-->

          <tr>
            <th>Overfishing</th>
            <td>Overfishing occurs when we catch fish too fast, not giving them enough time to reproduce. This causes disturbance to the balance of their reproduction cycle and this can be very dangerous, as this can lead to extinction of other species. One of the most affected places is the Mediterranean sea. There has been about 90% of unsustainable fishing. A main reason it affects other species is because of how they are connected by the food chain - from predators like sharks to smaller fishes relying on healthy food resources. So when species are extinct predators that consume them would not be able to survive. Therefore, without a sustainable fishing activity, our ocean would not survive! We have fished over 179 million tons of seafood through the years and 34% of this is overfished.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Climate Change</th>
            <td>Climate change is when the ocean water turns warmer, sea levels rise, ocean acidification and polar ice melts. These changes can change the patterns of a species migration, breeding cycle and they are even powerful enough to change an entire ecosystem. The ocean water becomes warmer because of the high absorption of carbon dioxide, making the ocean more acidic (low pH), this can lead to damage to species like crabs, oysters and corals to build shells. When there is too much carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere and turns too hot, it will start melting the ices in the polar region, this is one of the main reasons the sea levels rise. This is a major problem for species like polar bears, seals and any arctic animals as they won't have an area to hunt or live, also this could disrupt the food chain and the fish populations could also change. But this becomes even more threatening as, when the sea levels rise coastal areas like New York or Tokyo could face the risk of being flooded just like Marshall Island. Reports have shown that since 1880 the sea level has increased about 8 to 9 inches more. Between 2000 and 2023 glaciers melted about 6542billion tonnes of ice.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Habitat Destruction</th>
            <td>From coastal development such as dredging, wharves, ports and many more human activities play a crucial role in destroying the marine habitat. This is a major risk, as, like we depend on food, houses and water, the marine lives rely mostly on these underwater habitats that we destroy. Coral reefs, mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds are some of the essential parts for marine life and by destroying them we are reducing the space available for them to live, resulting in them being homeless or without resources to recover. Moreove, studies have shown that because of our human activities it is estimated that since 1870 we have lost 50% coral reef, 40% of mangroves and a descrease of 43% in marine animal populations since 1970 and with the result of killing and altering the marine ecosystem we have changed ⅓ of the ocean.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Oil Spills</th>
            <td>Oil spills are another major risk for the marine ecosystem as when the oil is spilled into the ocean it spreads and coats everything it comes into contact  such as coral reefs and other species living in the ocean. In 2024 alone 10,000 tons of oil has been spilled into the ocean. Even a little bit of this oil spill could poison the marine ecosystem, and stay for decades. The long-term damage to the ecosystem lingers far beyond the surface we see.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Chemical Runoff</th>
            <td>Chemical Runoff is when industrial chemicals or fertilizers or pesticides from factories or farms end up in rivers or lakes, then this flow straight to the ocean. We have discussed many factors to the damage to the marine ecosystem,however, chemical runoff alone contributes 80% to this damage. This can be harmful and life threatening as the chemicals that flow into the water could be toxic. If the amount of this toxic in the water is it could make the oxygen level in the water drop and this would make that a where little to no species could live.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Coral Bleaching</th>
            <td>Coral bleaching is when  the risks like the one discussed affect the corals making them drive out a type of algae that lives in its tissues, that gives them food and colour to survive. So when this happens the corals lose their colour this leaves behind the corals looking like a skeleton. This process is known as bleaching. Due to the lack of nutrition the corals are now more exposed to diseases and starvation. As this process starts killing the reefs, an entire ecosystem could go extinct and this could put many marine species in danger as well. Since the first of January 2023 84% of coral reefs have been affected by this increase of bleaching.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Noise Pollution</th>
            <td>Noises from ships, drilling, sonar, and construction and many more noises overwhelm marine life. This is because if the noises are too loud from human activities, then this can make the marine species difficult to distinguish between their natural sound, as some species use sound to communicate. For example species like dolphins and whales use sound to hunt and talk to each other are some animals that are being severely affected by this problem. Even though noise pollution is often overlooked because it can’t be seen, this is a serious problem affecting many marine species. But this is a serious issue that needs attention as this makes animals stressed about finding food, mates and identifying predators. If we let it unnoticed this could threaten many species survival and result in us losing many types of marine ecosystems. An example of this is since 1960 the sound levels have increased about 3-4db. This is mainly ships and boats used for cargo or rides we humans take every day.</td>
