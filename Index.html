       <p>Our oceans are irreplaceable and indispensable to us and this planet. So it is our duty to keep it unharmed from any potential threats. But we are occasionally ignoring the threats they are facing and treating them without any care and respect. Therefore, through this website I hope to bring out some of the major risks they are facing and what we can do to help.</p><!--This is the second paragraph-->

  <p>he ocean is more than just waves and water, itâ€™s home to millions of living creatures, that all play a huge role in keeping this planet safe:</p>
    <table><!--This is where the table starts-->
      <tr><!--This is the first row for the table-->
        <td>The ocean also acts as a sponge with the help of its ecosystem to absorb the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to help cool down the planet</td><!--This is table data for the first row-->
      </tr><!--This is where the first row ends-->
<!--This table row then table data will keep repeating until the end of the table-->
      <tr>
        <td>Many plants in the ocean produce oxygen like seaweed, marine sea grass. But phytoplankton are responsible for producing about 50% to 80% of the oxygen in the atmosphere. They carry out the process of photosynthesis using sunlight and carbon dioxide from its surrounding waters that have already absorbed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Every creature from fishes, sharks, seaweeds to coral, help maintain the balance of the ocean. This is by maintaining the cycle of natural food chains. For example the products like phytoplankton are eaten by primary consumers like zooplankton, which is then eaten by secondary consumers like jellyfish, then tertiary consumers like larger fish, then predators like the sharks eat the tertiary consumers. Lastly when organisms die, they decompose, giving the nutrients they ate back to the ocean.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Millions of people rely on the ocean for food, medicine and even jobs. Fishes and seaweed are a must in many diets for many people, as it contains nutrients and proteins. Especially people near coastal areas and islands rely mostly on these types of food.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Many like oyster and sea cucumbers purify water by removing  particles like nitrogen and phosphorus, which can create algae if there is too much. But there is a difference: oysters are filter feeders that mean they strain out the excess particles while sea cucumbers are deposit feeders meaning they consume the particle and deliver nutrients.</td>
