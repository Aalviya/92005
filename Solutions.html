       <h2>The Three R's</h2>
       <p>By adding the three R’s into your life you can help stop the consumption and production of waste. The three R’s stand for: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. These three R’s are an easy way for people to reduce the use of waste.</p>
       <p>Reduce means buying or using fewer items. Don’t buy items made with plastic if it’s not essential for you.</p>
       <p>Even if you do buy, use the second R, reuse it. It doesn't have to be for a single purpose. For example plastic drink bottles could be used as storage, planters, watering cans and you can even turn into a DIY decoration.</p>
       <p>The third R: Recycle means making new material out of waste products like plastic, glass, paper etc. So when you don’t want to reuse or have too much  waste products in your home, you can just put them into your recycling bin. These can then get through several steps like cleaning, shredding, melting, then finally turned into a new recycled product.</p>
       <p>Using these three R’s into your life could help manage the amount of plastic or waste coming into the ocean and polluting the land. Managing waste is really important as if it were dumped into the ocean, marine animals could consume this mistaking it for their food. Some waste products would become twisted in these animal’s bodies, this could be dangerous as waste like plastic could choke the animals and if it is glass, it could cut them, if the cut is deep it could be life threatening.But this does not just affect the animals it also affects the plant. This is because plastics could get tangled into the plants limiting the plants from undergoing photosynthesis. Waste is not just bad for the marine it is also bad for the land as if we were to pile up in the land it would take a long time to degrade. So before you buy, think, do you really need it?</p>

       <h2> Beach Clean-up programmes</h2>
       <p>There might be communities or groups around you that might have programmes they have planned to clean any water bodies near you. This could be really helpful as when you do these programmes you can find waste left around by other people and pick them up before they enter the ocean or come in contact with marine animals. This also helps people together promote Kaitiakitanga and show Manaakitanga to your community and this planet.</p>

       <h2>Save Water</h2>
       <p>Saving water is a simple but important way to protect our environment. When we use too much water, it puts pressure on our water sources and increases pollution that can end up in rivers and oceans. Here are some easy ways you can save water every day.</p>
       <p>Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth. Take shorter showers (try setting a timer!). Fix dripping faucets and leaking pipes quickly. Only run the washing machine or dishwasher when it’s full. Use a bucket instead of a hose when washing your car or watering plants. Collect rainwater to water your garden. Choose native plants that need less water. These small actions can make a big difference.</p>
       <p>If everyone does their part, we can help protect our freshwater and reduce the waste entering our oceans.</p>
