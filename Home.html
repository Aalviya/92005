         <h2>Come and Help Save Our Ocean Life!</h2>
         <p>Imagine taking a walk on you favourite beach, but there are no sound of the seagulls or the clear blue waves crashing on to the shore. You walk further only to find dead marine life tangled in plastic!</p>
         <p>Our oceans are irreplaceable and indispensable to us and this planet. So it is our duty to keep it unharmed from any potential threats. But we are occasionally ignoring the threats they are facing and treating them without any care and respect. Therefore, through this website I hope to bring out some of the major risks they are facing and what we can do to help.</p>

    <h2>How Marine Life is Crucial for Planet!</h2>
    <p>The ocean is more than just waves and water, it's home to million of living creatures, that plays a huge role on keeping this planet safe:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>The ocean also acts as a sponge with the help of its ecosystem to absorb the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to help cool down the planet</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Many plants in the ocean produce oxygen like seaweed, marine seagrass. But phytoplankton are responsible for producing about 50% to 80% of the oxygen in the atmosphere. They carry out the process of photosynthesis using sunlight and carbon dioxide from its surrounding waters that have already absorbed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Every creature, from fishes, sharks, seaweeds to coral help maintain the balance of the ocean. This is by maintaining the cycle of natural food chains. For example the products like phytoplankton are eaten by primary consumers like zooplankton, which is then eaten by secondary consumers like jellyfish, then tertiary consumers like larger fish, then predators like the sharks eat the tertiary consumers. Lastly when organisms die, they decompense, giving the nutrients they ate back to the ocean.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Millions of people rely on the ocean for food, medicine and even jobs. Fishes and seaweed are a must in many diets for many people, as it contains nutrients and proteins. Especially people near coastal areas and islands rely mostly on these types of food. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Many species like oyster and sea cucumbers purify water by removing  particles like nitrogen and phosphorus, which can create algae if there is too much. But there is a difference: oysters are filter feeders that mean they strain out the excess particles while sea cucumbers are deposit feeders meaning they consume the particle and deliver nutrients.</td>
